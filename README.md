# Machine-Learning-Project

This project aims to model car prices using various independent variables, enabling a Chinese automobile company to understand and strategize its entry into the US market. The analysis focuses on identifying significant predictors of car prices, understanding their relationships, and building robust machine learning models.

Business Problem
The company seeks to:

Identify key variables influencing car prices in the US market.
Understand how these variables affect pricing.
Leverage these insights to optimize car design, features, and pricing strategies.
The project involves building predictive models to analyze the pricing dynamics and assist in decision-making.

Steps in the Analysis

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Import the dataset and libraries.
Inspect and clean the data (e.g., handle missing values, duplicate records, etc.).
Convert categorical variables to numerical ones (e.g., using one-hot encoding or label encoding).
Normalize/standardize numerical features as required.

3. Model Implementation
The following machine learning models were implemented for predicting car prices:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

4. Model Evaluation
Each model's performance was evaluated based on:
R-squared: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Quantifies prediction error magnitude.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average magnitude of errors.

4. Feature Importance Analysis
Identified significant variables using feature importance scores from tree-based models.
Analyzed coefficients for linear models to gauge variable significance.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimized model performance using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
Compared pre- and post-tuning results.

Key Features
The most significant variables affecting car prices were:
[Feature 1]
[Feature 2]
[Feature 3] ...
These features were identified through:

Feature importance scores.
Statistical significance in regression models.
Hyperparameter Tuning
The performance of the [Best Model] improved after hyperparameter tuning:

Before: R-squared = X, MSE = Y, MAE = Z
After: R-squared = X, MSE = Y, MAE = Z

Conclusion

The [Best Model] effectively predicts car prices in the US market.
Significant predictors like [Key Features] provide actionable insights for designing competitive cars for the American market.
